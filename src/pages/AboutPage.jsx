      <h1>About The Clarity Coach</h1>
      <p className="mission"><strong>Our Mission:</strong> To translate communication styles, not people. We believe that clearer communication builds more inclusive, effective, and compassionate workplaces and communities.</p>
      <div className="content-block">
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Ever feel like you're speaking clearly but your message doesn't land? This often happens because we're running on different communication "operating systems"â€”one prioritizing directness and data, the other social rapport and context.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="content-block">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>This tool acts as a bridge, not a correction tool. It translates messages between communication styles, helping neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals understand each other more clearly without changing who they are.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Important Limitations & Our Guiding Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Neurodiversity is a Spectrum:</strong> We use "ND" and "NT" to describe communication *styles*, not to rigidly label people.</li>
          <li><strong>Context is Everything:</strong> The tool analyzes text, but it cannot analyze the tone of a room or your relationship with the other person.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification is Key:</strong> The ultimate goal is better human connection. The AI can be wrong. Always verify understanding through direct conversation.</li>
      </ul>
