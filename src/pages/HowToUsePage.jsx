      <h1>How to Use the Clarity Coach</h1>
      <p className="mission">This guide will help you get the most out of the Beta version by explaining its features and workflows with clear examples.</p>
      
      <h2>Core Features: Draft, Analyze, and Chat</h2>

      <div className="content-block">
          <h3>Draft a Message</h3>
          <p>Use this mode when you have a thought you need to share effectively.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What I Mean (Intent):</strong> Enter the core goal of your message.</li>
            <li><strong>What I Wrote (Draft):</strong> Enter your raw thoughts or a rough draft.</li>
            <li>The AI will then explain potential misinterpretations and provide a polished, translated draft.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="content-block">
          <h3>Analyze a Message</h3>
          <p>Use this mode when you receive a message that is confusing or has a hidden meaning.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What They Wrote:</strong> Paste the message you received.</li>
            <li><strong>What's the Situation? (Context):</strong> Briefly explain the circumstances (e.g., "This is from my boss, and the project is late."). This gives the AI crucial context.</li>
            <li><strong>How I Heard It:</strong> Explain how the message made you feel or what you think it means.</li>
            <li>The AI will then analyze the sender's likely intent and suggest a strategic response.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="content-block">
          <h3>Chat with the Coach</h3>

            <li><strong>Role-play a Conversation:</strong> Practice a difficult conversation in a safe space. For example, "Let's practice a performance review. You be my manager."</li>
